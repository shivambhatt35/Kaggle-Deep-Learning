## Course Overview

The course is organized into six main lessons:

1. **A Single Neuron**  
   - Learn about linear units, the building blocks of deep learning.  
   - Understand how a single neuron can model simple relationships in data.  

2. **Deep Neural Networks**  
   - Add hidden layers to your network to uncover complex relationships.  
   - Understand the concept of depth in neural networks and non-linear transformations.  

3. **Stochastic Gradient Descent**  
   - Train your first neural network using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.  
   - Learn about optimization, loss functions, and updating weights through gradient descent.  

4. **Overfitting and Underfitting**  
   - Improve model performance by addressing overfitting or underfitting.  
   - Learn strategies like early stopping and adjusting network capacity.  

5. **Dropout and Batch Normalization**  
   - Add special layers to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.  
   - Understand how Dropout and Batch Normalization improve generalization and training speed.  

6. **Binary Classification**  
   - Apply deep learning to solve a binary classification problem.  
   - Learn evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the importance of model validation.
